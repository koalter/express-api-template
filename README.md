# express-api-template
This repository works as a template for future APIs done with ExpressJS

It contains a basic router for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE functions, a Model-Controller-Service structure, and a database mock file.

Some things I'm planning to add to this project are:
* Unit Testing
* A database connection
* Authentication and Authorization
* Integration with Typescript
